?add "and" option to quick filter
?Add advance filter in main table for genemetadata
?Add splash screen/using j exe
?allow changing info cols in project
?avoid light colors
?improve pval skip smaller associations
?include gephi graph toolkit
?load gene metadata
?Make table more readable
?Make windows part of project windows
?MCL clustering
?save prog params with mog params not with project
?use Lucene for reading files
?use of ND4J
add actions to help buttons
add bar chart
add chart annotator for replicate plot
add data size to plot legends
add grouping var name in corr detail
add java color e.g. https://github.com/rcsb/colorbrewer ?
add mean lines to plot
add p val corection to diff corr
add project info to display project files etc
add pval correction methods
add scroll in annotation table
add separate correlation pane?
add spearman corr for samps
add threshold to all pairwise computation
add utility function to filter out colors that match background of plot
add xml read support for metadata
Allow to add rows in data as function of selected rows e.g. select genes and add avg of those in each sample or all sample as a new row, or select one gene and its avg over all the sample
Allow to hide show series; arrange histogram. make more interactive
allow user to add a short description to correlation column which will be displayed on mouse hover; save the descriptions with project; by default add current data selection, list information in the description;this makes easier to recognize computations
Allows Spliting Sample attributes in MOG e.g. (a1:v1||a2:v2||a3:v3) should add three attribute a1, a2, a3 with values v1, v2, v3
atleast two rows should be selected for scatter plot 
bug in alphanumeric sort main table
build reps column is slow again
change def rep col set to current selected col, only call func if changed
chart fonts and size
check shuff in group when repsmap is data column
combine metadata terms to group expression e.g. tumor+tissue will give liver,normal; liver,tumor; stomach,normal;stomach,tumor etc.
convert to internal frames
create a common class to handle plot functions from different tables
create a filter based on gene expression
dashed vs solid error bar
deal with illegal chars
delete metadata not working
DTP bring to top
execute other R script ask for out file name 
filter corrleation details table by r and pval
fix alphanumeric comparator for case sensitive values
fix cancelling logfc
fix email send without pass
fix shuff in group/order is different
Handle memory efficiently for analyzing runs (cosine sim, etc)
Have chart its own excluded data values; Add refresh options to chart sync with current workspace; Allow to filter in current chart only. 
How error is plotted in avg chart??
improve sample series plot
in pearson corr no pval, if data is missing it skips the cols with missing data. Change this to return 0 if a column is missing for a row.
initialize trivial metadata table is none is given
Invert selection in Dual table panel while editing or creating list//add actions
kruskalWalis test
list merge handle case sensitive names e.g. C15ORF37
make color themes
MI,spearman,PC, test all
mog correlation detail table; remove "load table" function for now
move splitindex to project class
option to edit metadata
order of groups in line chart, hist etc.
p values histogram
plot as series xaxis label
pvalue doesn't show in list
remove genes from plot once a plot is drawn
remove special chars from data columns	
reset rows update title
revise edit info column function;keep or remove
save correlation matrix as robject
save diff exp res
set plot background in properties
show header name on hover
show list size on hover 
show num of cd used in rep plot metadata
sort boxplots by mean median..
Sort in chart while grouped by metadata
test groupDataIndexbyRepColumn()
Test tree building algorithm thoroughly
try plotly
update boxplot/add more options to boxplot interactions/split box plots type by metadata/color by different types categories// add tooltip
update default rep columns as data is filtered
update tips
use "feature" instead of genes/rows
user function for transformation;add option to clip -ve values to 0
venn diagrams fo correlated genes?
wrap text in metadta tree/table
