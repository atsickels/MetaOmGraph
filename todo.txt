?add "and" option to quick filter
?Add advance filter in main table for genemetadata
?Add splash screen/using j exe
?avoid light colors
?improve pval skip smaller associations
?include gephi graph toolkit
?load gene metadata
?Make table more readable
?Make windows part of project windows
?MCL clustering
?save prog params with mog params not with project
?use Lucene for reading files
?use of ND4J
add chart annotator for replicate plot
add mean lines to plot
add scroll in annotation table
add xml read support for metadata
?allow changing info cols in project
Allows Spliting Sample attributes in MOG e.g. (a1:v1||a2:v2||a3:v3) should add three attribute a1, a2, a3 with values v1, v2, v3
$check for auto updates
check shuff in group when repsmap is data column
fix email send without pass
plot as series xaxis label
Sort in chart while grouped by metadata
Test tree building algorithm thoroughly
try plotly
MI,spearman,PC, test all
$double stars in project title
in pearson corr no pval, if data is missing it skips the cols with missing data. Change this to return 0 if a column is missing for a row.
pvalue doesn't show in list
fix shuff in group/order is different
add grouping var name in corr detail
convert to internal frames
show header name on hover
wrap text in metadta tree/table
reset rows update title
show num of cd used in rep plot metadata
change def rep col set to current selected col, only call func if changed
build reps column is slow again
remove genes from plot once a plot is drawn
add project info to display project files etc
save correlation matrix as robject
atleast two rows should be selected for scatter plot 
update tips
set plot background in properties
$filter last search problems with jtable
$spearman correlation slow
$fix scatterplot metadata
add actions to help buttons
mog correlation detail table; remove "load table" function for now
filter corrleation details table by r and pval
user function for transformation;add option to clip -ve values to 0
update boxplot/add more options to boxplot interactions/split box plots type by metadata/color by different types categories// add tooltip
improve sample series plot
make color themes
execute other R script ask for out file name 
initialize trivial metadata table is none is given
show list size on hover 
Invert selection in Dual table panel while editing or creating list//add actions
allow user to add a short description to correlation column which will be displayed on mouse hover; save the descriptions with project; by default add current data selection, list information in the description;this makes easier to recognize computations
Allow to add rows in data as function of selected rows e.g. select genes and add avg of those in each sample or all sample as a new row, or select one gene and its avg over all the sample
How error is plotted in avg chart??
use "feature" instead of genes/rows
add java color e.g. https://github.com/rcsb/colorbrewer ?
add utility function to filter out colors that match background of plot
p values histogram
add separate correlation pane?
DTP bring to top
combine metadata terms to group expression e.g. tumor+tissue will give liver,normal; liver,tumor; stomach,normal;stomach,tumor etc.
add threshold to all pairwise computation
plot selected series/features in box plot
venn diagrams fo correlated genes?
Have chart its own excluded data values; Add refresh options to chart sync with current workspace; Allow to filter in current chart only. 
Allow to hide show series; arrange histogram. make more interactive
does cluster function exclude columns ???
create a common class to handle plot functions from different tables
add data size to plot legends
$improve import list
$list intersection and union
$when saving query, also save match all or match any flag
delete metadata not working
$test list intersection
move splitindex to project class
update default rep columns as data is filtered

kruskalWalis test
sort boxplots by mean median..
add gene cards to external search
add pval correction methods
