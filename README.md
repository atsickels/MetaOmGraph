## Overview ##

MetaOmGraph (MOG) is a Java software to interactively explore and visualize large datasets. MOG overcomes the challenges posed by big size and complexity of big datasets by efficient handling of data files by using a combination of data indexing and buffering schemes. By incorporating metadata, MOG adds another dimension to the analyses and provides flexibility in data exploration. MOG allows users to explore their own data on their local machines. The user can save the progress at any stage of analysis to a MOG project file. Saved MOG projects can be shared, reused, and included in publications. MOG is user-centered software, designed for all types of data, but specialized for expression data. It combines the ability to analyze very large data sets in real time with metadata analysis, statistical analysis, list-making, and graphing capabilities.
