## Overview ##

MetaOmGraph is written in Java (JRE 1.8 or later required), so it is compatible with any Java-supported platform, including Windows, OS X, and Linux. MetaOmGraph can handle any sort of data that is stored in a delimited text file. Although designed to work with 'omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc), MetaOmGraph is flexible enough to accommodate storing, manipulating, plotting and analyzing other biological data or, in fact, voluminous data of nearly any kind.
