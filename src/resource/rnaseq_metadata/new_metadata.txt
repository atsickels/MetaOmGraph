However, the relative iNAccessibility of the female gametophyte has limited the availability of genome-scale data on this structure. We have taken advantage of the relatively large size of the maize female gametophyte to sequence triplicate replicated RNA-Seq libraries using the IllumiNA platform from dissected B73 embryo sacs, comparator ovules, mature pollen (the male gametophyte) and seedlings (as a baseline sporophytic comparison).

NAtural sources of resistance from maize genotypes are used in conventioNAl breeding approaches, but the sigNAls and effectors involved in resistance in this important crop species are not well understood. Early transcriptioNAl changes associated with F. verticillioides infection were aNAlysed in resistant CO441 and susceptible CO354 maize genotypes using RNA-Sequencing technology. Transcript level were measured at 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi), reflecting the time point immediately preceding the onset of resistance in CO441, as determined by the absolute quantification of the fungal ???????-tubulin2 gene. More than 100 million sequence reads were generated for condition (inoculated/uninoculated). The sequence reads were aNAlyzed to measure gene expression levels and determine single nucleotide polymorphisms. We observed 2,551 transcripts with statistically significant differential expression before inoculation by comparing uninoculated control samples. Overall, a more induced expression of genes distributed in all functioNAl classes is found in the CO441 genotype, in particular a high percentage of differentially genes were more expressed only in the resistant genotype for the functioNAl class secondary metabolism. Furthermore, a total of 2,250 and 2,442 transcripts were differentially regulated after F. verticillioides inoculation in resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The genes in common were 1,028 genes and showed 5,342 SNPs variants, suggesting a certain variability in the defense responses of the two genotypes. Also at 72 hpi, secondary metabolism was the category where the most interesting differences between the two genotypes were observed to a greater extent. Pathways related to phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (e.g. anthranilate synthase, shikimate kiNAse), flavonoid biosynthesis (e.g. chalcone synthase) and lignin biosynthesis (e.g. cinNAmyl-alcohol dehydrogeNAse) appeared to be strongly influenced by infection in the CO441 genotype with up to 11-fold induction. Response to stress and resistance categories followed. In addition, transcriptioNAl modulation affected sigNAl transduction, including calcium sigNAling, ethylene sigNAling, MAP kiNAses, receptor-like kiNAses, and numerous transcription factors. Even though all these genes were well represented in both genotypes, it was observed that on the whole CO441 mounts a stronger gene induction, confirming its strengthening also in the specific response to inoculation. The identification of plant candidate resistance genes that interact with fungus could be exploited in future biotechnological approaches to increase disease resistance in susceptible maize genotypes."

The endosperm of cereals is a main source of food, feed, and industrial raw materials worldwide. However, the gene regulatory networks that control endosperm cell differentiation remain largely unclear. As a first step toward characterizing these networks, we profiled the mRNAs in five major cell types of the differentiating endosperm and in the embryo and four materNAl compartments of the kernel. Comparisons of these mRNA populations revealed the diverged gene expression programs between filial and materNAl compartments, and an unexpected close correlation between embryo and the aleurone layer of endosperm. Gene co-expression network aNAlysis identified co-expression modules associated with single or multiple kernel compartments including modules for the endosperm cell types, some of which showed enrichment of previously identified temporally activated and/or imprinted genes. Detailed aNAlyses of a co-expression module highly correlated with the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) identified a regulatory module activated by MRP-1, a regulator of BETL differentiation and function. These results provide a high-resolution atlas of gene activity in the compartments of the maize kernel and help to uncover the regulatory modules associated with the differentiation of the major endosperm cell types. Overall design: RNAs from ten compartments of the maize kernel including the central starchy endosperm (CSE), conducting zone (CZ), aleurone (AL), basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), embryo-surrounding region (ESR), nucellus (NU), pericarp (PE), placenta-chalazal region (PC), the vascular region of the pedicel (PED), and the embryo (EMB) were isolated at 8 days after polliNAtion (DAP) using laser-capture microdissection and sequenced using an IllumiNA HiSeq 2000 platform."

The maize leaf is an ideal system to study plant morphogenesis as it is subdivided into a proximal sheath and a distal blade, each with distinct developmental patterning. Specialised ligule and auricle structures form at the blade-sheath boundary. The auricles act as a hinge, allowing the leaf blade to project at an angle from the stem, while the ligule comprises an epidermally-derived fringe. Recessive liguleless1 mutants lack ligules and auricles, and have upright leaves. We utilized laser-microdissection RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed along discrete cell/tissue-specific domains along the proximal-distal axis of wild-type leaf primordia undergoing ligule initiation, and compared transcript accumulation in wild type and liguleless1 mutant leaf primordia. We identified transcripts that are specifically upregulated at the blade-sheath boundary. A surprising number of these ligule genes are also implicated to function during leaf initiation or lateral branching, and intersect multiple hormoNAl sigNAlling pathways. We propose that genetic modules utilised in leaf and/or branch initiation are redeployed to regulate ligule outgrowth from leaf primordia. Overall design: In this study, we aNAlysed the transcriptome associated with ligule formation using laser microdissection RNA-sequencing (LM-RNAseq). We quantified transcript accumulation in the PLB and adjacent pre-blade and pre-sheath regions of wild-type leaf primordia in order to identify candidate genes involved in proximal-distal patterning at the blade-sheath boundary. We also compared transcript accumulation in lg1-R mutants and wild-type siblings to identity genes acting downstream of LG1."	GEO	NA	NA

We observed a gradual increase of paterNAl gene mRNAs in the 3- and 5-DAP kernels. In the 7-DAP endosperm, the majority of the tested genes reached a ratio of 2m:1p suggesting that paterNAl genes were nearly fully activated by 7 DAP.

The highest amount of paterNAlly expressed genes (PEGs) was found at 7 DAP mainly due to the significantly deviated parental allele expression ratio of these genes at this stage, while nearly 80% of the materNAlly expressed genes (MEGs) were specific to 10 DAP which were primarily attributed to the sharply increased expression levels compared to the other stages.

For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.  For ramosa mutant series, segregating families (1:1) of ra1-R, ra2-R, and ra3-fea1 mutant alleles, all introgressed at least 6 times into the B73 inbred background, were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Field-grown plants were genotyped and collected 6-7 weeks after germiNAtion (V7-V8 stage).  First and second ear primordia were immediately hand-dissected, measured, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  For ra1, ra2 and ra3 mutants and wild-type controls, ears were pooled into two size classes: 1) 1mm class included a range of 0.7-1.5mm sized ears and nine ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates; 2) 2mm class included a range of 1.8-2.5mm sized ears and six ears were pooled for each of three biological replicates.  Wild-type samples were proportioNAl mixtures of heterozygote siblings segregating in ra1, ra2, and ra3 populations.  Variability factors (e.g. ear size within class, ear rank on the plant, and time of collection) were distributed evenly across pooled samples."	GEO	NA	NA

Furthermore, increased transcript abundance of genes encoding serine-threonine receptor-like kiNAses calmodulin, as well as zinc-finger and WRKY transcription factors have been identified. Other up-regulated genes encode proteins involved in protein degradation, i.e. proteases, ubiquitin ligases, as well as enzymes involved in synthesis of auxin or cytokinin phytohormones. In comparison, 2164 genes were more than 2.5-fold down-regulated in maize leaves infected by PtrpC:GLS1 strains, as compared to WT-infected leaves. Several of the encoded proteins are known susceptibility factors. Forty-six down-regulated genes code for proteins containing iron or manganese, or are involved in uptake of these ions, suggesting major re-arrangement of the redox-status in maize leaves after ???????-glucan perception. Overall design: ExamiNAtion of plant defense responses in maize plants inoculated with 2 different Colletotrichum graminicola strains."	GEO	NA	NA

As a first step toward characterizing these networks, we profiled the mRNAs in five major cell types of the differentiating endosperm and in the embryo and four materNAl compartments of the kernel. Comparisons of these mRNA populations revealed the diverged gene expression programs between filial and materNAl compartments, and an unexpected close correlation between embryo and the aleurone layer of endosperm.

For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.  For ramosa mutant series, segregating families (1:1) of ra1-R, ra2-R, and ra3-fea1 mutant alleles, all introgressed at least 6 times into the B73 inbred background, were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Field-grown plants were genotyped and collected 6-7 weeks after germiNAtion (V7-V8 stage).  First and second ear primordia were immediately hand-dissected, measured, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  For ra1, ra2 and ra3 mutants and wild-type controls, ears were pooled into two size classes: 1) 1mm class included a range of 0.7-1.5mm sized ears and nine ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates; 2) 2mm class included a range of 1.8-2.5mm sized ears and six ears were pooled for each of three biological replicates.  Wild-type samples were proportioNAl mixtures of heterozygote siblings segregating in ra1, ra2, and ra3 populations.

Gene co-expression network aNAlysis identified co-expression modules associated with single or multiple kernel compartments including modules for the endosperm cell types, some of which showed enrichment of previously identified temporally activated and/or imprinted genes. Detailed aNAlyses of a co-expression module highly correlated with the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) identified a regulatory module activated by MRP-1, a regulator of BETL differentiation and function. These results provide a high-resolution atlas of gene activity in the compartments of the maize kernel and help to uncover the regulatory modules associated with the differentiation of the major endosperm cell types. Overall design: RNAs from ten compartments of the maize kernel including the central starchy endosperm (CSE), conducting zone (CZ), aleurone (AL), basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), embryo-surrounding region (ESR), nucellus (NU), pericarp (PE), placenta-chalazal region (PC), the vascular region of the pedicel (PED), and the embryo (EMB) were isolated at 8 days after polliNAtion (DAP) using laser-capture microdissection and sequenced using an IllumiNA HiSeq 2000 platform."

The maize leaf is an ideal system to study plant morphogenesis as it is subdivided into a proximal sheath and a distal blade, each with distinct developmental patterning. Specialised ligule and auricle structures form at the blade-sheath boundary. The auricles act as a hinge, allowing the leaf blade to project at an angle from the stem, while the ligule comprises an epidermally-derived fringe. Recessive liguleless1 mutants lack ligules and auricles, and have upright leaves. We utilized laser-microdissection RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed along discrete cell/tissue-specific domains along the proximal-distal axis of wild-type leaf primordia undergoing ligule initiation, and compared transcript accumulation in wild type and liguleless1 mutant leaf primordia. We identified transcripts that are specifically upregulated at the blade-sheath boundary. A surprising number of these ligule genes are also implicated to function during leaf initiation or lateral branching, and intersect multiple hormoNAl sigNAlling pathways. We propose that genetic modules utilised in leaf and/or branch initiation are redeployed to regulate ligule outgrowth from leaf primordia. Overall design: In this study, we aNAlysed the transcriptome associated with ligule formation using laser microdissection RNA-sequencing (LM-RNAseq). We quantified transcript accumulation in the PLB and adjacent pre-blade and pre-sheath regions of wild-type leaf primordia in order to identify candidate genes involved in proximal-distal patterning at the blade-sheath boundary. We also compared transcript accumulation in lg1-R mutants and wild-type siblings to identity genes acting downstream of LG1."	GEO	NA	NA

The maize mini-chromosome Derivative 3-3 contains a de novo centromere, which was derived from a euchromatic site on the short arm of chromosome 9 that lacks traditioNAl centromeric repeat sequences. Our previous study found that the CENH3 binding domain of this de novo centromere is only 288 kb with a high-density gene distribution with low-density of transposons. Here we applied next generation sequencing technology to aNAlyze gene transcription, DNA methylation for this region. Our RNA-seq data revealed that active chromatin is not a barrier for de novo centromere formation. Bisulfite-ChIP-seq results indicate a slightly increased DNA methylation level after de novo centromere formation, reaching the level of a NAtive centromere. These results provide insight into the mechanism of de novo centromere formation and subsequent consequences.

To map the imprintome of the early developing endosperm in maize, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of the kernels at 0, 3, 5 days after polliNAtion (DAP) and the endosperms at 7, 10, and 15 DAP produced from the B73 and Mo17 reciprocal crosses. We observed a gradual increase of paterNAl gene mRNAs in the 3- and 5-DAP kernels. In the 7-DAP endosperm, the majority of the tested genes reached a ratio of 2m:1p suggesting that paterNAl genes were nearly fully activated by 7 DAP. A total of 116, 234 and 63 imprinted genes exhibiting parent-specific expression were identified in the 7-, 10-, and 15-DAP endosperms, respectively. The highest amount of paterNAlly expressed genes (PEGs) was found at 7 DAP mainly due to the significantly deviated parental allele expression ratio of these genes at this stage, while nearly 80% of the materNAlly expressed genes (MEGs) were specific to 10 DAP which were primarily attributed to the sharply increased expression levels compared to the other stages.

We characterized developmental transitions by associating spatiotemporal expression profiles with morphological changes resulting from genetic perturbations that disrupt steps in a pathway controlling branching.  These are the RNA-seq datasets used in this study. Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.  For ramosa mutant series, segregating families (1:1) of ra1-R, ra2-R, and ra3-fea1 mutant alleles, all introgressed at least 6 times into the B73 inbred background, were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Field-grown plants were genotyped and collected 6-7 weeks after germiNAtion (V7-V8 stage).  First and second ear primordia were immediately hand-dissected, measured, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  For ra1, ra2 and ra3 mutants and wild-type controls, ears were pooled into two size classes: 1) 1mm class included a range of 0.7-1.5mm sized ears and nine ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates; 2) 2mm class included a range of 1.8-2.5mm sized ears and six ears were pooled for each of three biological replicates.  Wild-type samples were proportioNAl mixtures of heterozygote siblings segregating in ra1, ra2, and ra3 populations.

For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Overall design: In this study, we aNAlysed the transcriptome associated with ligule formation using laser microdissection RNA-sequencing (LM-RNAseq). We quantified transcript accumulation in the PLB and adjacent pre-blade and pre-sheath regions of wild-type leaf primordia in order to identify candidate genes involved in proximal-distal patterning at the blade-sheath boundary. We also compared transcript accumulation in lg1-R mutants and wild-type siblings to identity genes acting downstream of LG1."	GEO	NA	NA

We characterized developmental transitions by associating spatiotemporal expression profiles with morphological changes resulting from genetic perturbations that disrupt steps in a pathway controlling branching.  These are the RNA-seq datasets used in this study. Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.  For ramosa mutant series, segregating families (1:1) of ra1-R, ra2-R, and ra3-fea1 mutant alleles, all introgressed at least 6 times into the B73 inbred background, were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Field-grown plants were genotyped and collected 6-7 weeks after germiNAtion (V7-V8 stage).  First and second ear primordia were immediately hand-dissected, measured, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  For ra1, ra2 and ra3 mutants and wild-type controls, ears were pooled into two size classes: 1) 1mm class included a range of 0.7-1.5mm sized ears and nine ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates; 2) 2mm class included a range of 1.8-2.5mm sized ears and six ears were pooled for each of three biological replicates.  Wild-type samples were proportioNAl mixtures of heterozygote siblings segregating in ra1, ra2, and ra3 populations.  Variability factors (e.g. ear size within class, ear rank on the plant, and time of collection) were distributed evenly across pooled samples."	GEO	NA	NA

To map the imprintome of the early developing endosperm in maize, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of the kernels at 0, 3, 5 days after polliNAtion (DAP) and the endosperms at 7, 10, and 15 DAP produced from the B73 and Mo17 reciprocal crosses. We observed a gradual increase of paterNAl gene mRNAs in the 3- and 5-DAP kernels. In the 7-DAP endosperm, the majority of the tested genes reached a ratio of 2m:1p suggesting that paterNAl genes were nearly fully activated by 7 DAP. A total of 116, 234 and 63 imprinted genes exhibiting parent-specific expression were identified in the 7-, 10-, and 15-DAP endosperms, respectively. The highest amount of paterNAlly expressed genes (PEGs) was found at 7 DAP mainly due to the significantly deviated parental allele expression ratio of these genes at this stage, while nearly 80% of the materNAlly expressed genes (MEGs) were specific to 10 DAP which were primarily attributed to the sharply increased expression levels compared to the other stages. GO enrichment aNAlysis of the imprinted genes indicated the 10-DAP-specific MEGs were involved in the nutrient uptake and allocation through auxin sigNAling pathway in the maize endosperm coincident with the endosperm developmental stage associated with the beginning of starch and storage protein accumulation Overall design: The unpolliNAted kernels (0 DAP), the kernels of 3, 5 DAP and endosperms of 7 10, 15 DAP from the B73 and Mo17 reciprocal crosses were used to perform high-throughput sequencing using the IllumiNA HiSeq2000 platform"	GEO	NA	NA

We characterized developmental transitions by associating spatiotemporal expression profiles with morphological changes resulting from genetic perturbations that disrupt steps in a pathway controlling branching.  These are the RNA-seq datasets used in this study. Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.  For ramosa mutant series, segregating families (1:1) of ra1-R, ra2-R, and ra3-fea1 mutant alleles, all introgressed at least 6 times into the B73 inbred background, were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Field-grown plants were genotyped and collected 6-7 weeks after germiNAtion (V7-V8 stage).  First and second ear primordia were immediately hand-dissected, measured, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  For ra1, ra2 and ra3 mutants and wild-type controls, ears were pooled into two size classes: 1) 1mm class included a range of 0.7-1.5mm sized ears and nine ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates; 2) 2mm class included a range of 1.8-2.5mm sized ears and six ears were pooled for each of three biological replicates.

In order to identify transcripts specifically induced in leaves infected by ???????-1,3-glucan-exposing strains, transcript patterns of leaves inoculated with GLS1 overexpressing PtrpC:GLS1 strains were compared with those of the WT. In PtrpC:GLS1-inoculated leaves, a total of 2179 genes were more than 2.5-fold increased, with many genes known as genes typically up-regulated in PAMP-triggered defense responses. These genes include genes encoding PR proteins enzymes involved in cell wall re-inforcemen, and terpene synthases possibly involved in phytoalexin synthesis. Furthermore, increased transcript abundance of genes encoding serine-threonine receptor-like kiNAses calmodulin, as well as zinc-finger and WRKY transcription factors have been identified. Other up-regulated genes encode proteins involved in protein degradation, i.e. proteases, ubiquitin ligases, as well as enzymes involved in synthesis of auxin or cytokinin phytohormones. In comparison, 2164 genes were more than 2.5-fold down-regulated in maize leaves infected by PtrpC:GLS1 strains, as compared to WT-infected leaves. Several of the encoded proteins are known susceptibility factors. Forty-six down-regulated genes code for proteins containing iron or manganese, or are involved in uptake of these ions, suggesting major re-arrangement of the redox-status in maize leaves after ???????-glucan perception.

These are the RNA-seq datasets used in this study. Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.  For ramosa mutant series, segregating families (1:1) of ra1-R, ra2-R, and ra3-fea1 mutant alleles, all introgressed at least 6 times into the B73 inbred background, were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.

In some cases these changes may be accompanied by deletion of a conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) from one of the two homeologs, a testable source of the change in expression (Freeling et al (2012) Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 15:131-139). The most effective use of NAtural promoter bashing (fractioNAtion mutagenesis) utilizes cell-specific transcriptosomes. In this project cell-specific expression of maize homeologous genes is compared, using sorghum as an outgroup to differentiate gain-of-expression from loss-of-expression.In the first set of experiments, fractioNAtion mutagenesis is applied to two cell types undergoing tip growth, pollen and root hair, root hairs being defined as the difference in expression between root samples with and without root hairs. A third cell type, microspore, is also included.In the second set of experiments, fractioNAtion mutagenesis is applied to another very specific developmental target, the cell/tissue-specific domains in the leaf primordia at the blade-sheath boundary that initiate ligule formation. Sorghum epidermal blade and ligule transcriptosome data supplement transcriptosome data already available in maize (Johnston et al. (2014) Plant Cell 26:4718-4732) (SRA project PRJNA287059)."

In this project cell-specific expression of maize homeologous genes is compared, using sorghum as an outgroup to differentiate gain-of-expression from loss-of-expression.In the first set of experiments, fractioNAtion mutagenesis is applied to two cell types undergoing tip growth, pollen and root hair, root hairs being defined as the difference in expression between root samples with and without root hairs. A third cell type, microspore, is also included.In the second set of experiments, fractioNAtion mutagenesis is applied to another very specific developmental target, the cell/tissue-specific domains in the leaf primordia at the blade-sheath boundary that initiate ligule formation.

Limiting this progress are uncertainties about the complete structure mRNA transcripts, particularly with respect to alterNAtively spliced isoforms. Although second-generation RNA-seq provides a quantitative assay for transcriptioNAl and posttranscriptioNAl events, the accurate reconstruction of full-length mRNA isoforms is challenging with short-read technologies. By producing much longer reads, third generation sequencing offers to solve the assembly problem, but can suffer from lower read accuracy and throughput. Here, we combine these complementary technologies to define and quantify high-confidence transcript isoforms in maize. Six tissues (root, pollen, embryo, endosperm, immature ear, and immature tassel) of the B73 inbred line were used for mRNA sequencing with the IllumiNA Hiseq2000 PE101 platform to comprehensively quantitate gene/isoform expression. In parallel, intact cDNAs from the same samples were sequenced using the PacBio RS II platform. The latter used four size fractioNAted libraries (1-2kb, 2-3kb, 3kb-5kb, 5kb-10kb) to generate more than 2 million full length reads. PrelimiNAry findings suggest that mechanisms of alterNAtive splicing are differentially employed between different tissues. In addition, these data show promise to dramatically improve the status of maize genome annotation, with the detection of previously unidentified transcript isoforms, and uncovering previously unrecognized genes. This submission is data of IllumiNA Hiseq2000 PE101 reads."	NA	European Nucleotide Archive	NA

Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid N. For each tissue, at least 10 plants were pooled and about ~30 ears and tassels were pooled for each of 3 biological replicates. Maize B73 inbred lines were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Total RNA was prepared by grinding tissue in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 15596026) on dry ice and processed following the protocol provided by manufacturer. To remove DNA, an aliquot of total RNA was treated with RQ1 DNAse (Promega M6101), followed by phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol extraction, chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol extraction using Phase Lock Gel Light tubes (5 PRIME 2302800) and ethanol precipitation. RNA precipitate was stored in -20oC freezer. Total RNA (20 ??_???_g) was used for poly(A)+ selection using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen 610-02), eluted in water and used for RNA-seq library construction with ScriptSeqTM kit (Epicentre SS10906) or mRNA-seq Sample Prep kit (IllumiNA RS-100-0801) according to the manufacturer??????_?????_?s protocol. Libraries were amplified with 12-15 cycles of PCR, and then sequenced in two lanes on Hiseq2000 PE100 platform in woodbury Genome Center in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory."

Limiting this progress are uncertainties about the complete structure mRNA transcripts, particularly with respect to alterNAtively spliced isoforms. Although second-generation RNA-seq provides a quantitative assay for transcriptioNAl and posttranscriptioNAl events, the accurate reconstruction of full-length mRNA isoforms is challenging with short-read technologies. By producing much longer reads, third generation sequencing offers to solve the assembly problem, but can suffer from lower read accuracy and throughput. Here, we combine these complementary technologies to define and quantify high-confidence transcript isoforms in maize. Six tissues (root, pollen, embryo, endosperm, immature ear, and immature tassel) of the B73 inbred line were used for mRNA sequencing with the IllumiNA Hiseq2000 PE101 platform to comprehensively quantitate gene/isoform expression. In parallel, intact cDNAs from the same samples were sequenced using the PacBio RS II platform. The latter used four size fractioNAted libraries (1-2kb, 2-3kb, 3kb-5kb, 5kb-10kb) to generate more than 2 million full length reads. PrelimiNAry findings suggest that mechanisms of alterNAtive splicing are differentially employed between different tissues. In addition, these data show promise to dramatically improve the status of maize genome annotation, with the detection of previously unidentified transcript isoforms, and uncovering previously unrecognized genes.

Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid N. For each tissue, at least 10 plants were pooled and about ~30 ears and tassels were pooled for each of 3 biological replicates. Maize B73 inbred lines were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Total RNA was prepared by grinding tissue in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 15596026) on dry ice and processed following the protocol provided by manufacturer. To remove DNA, an aliquot of total RNA was treated with RQ1 DNAse (Promega M6101), followed by phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol extraction, chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol extraction using Phase Lock Gel Light tubes (5 PRIME 2302800) and ethanol precipitation. RNA precipitate was stored in -20oC freezer. Total RNA (20 ??_???_g) was used for poly(A)+ selection using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen 610-02), eluted in water and used for RNA-seq library construction with ScriptSeqTM kit (Epicentre SS10906) or mRNA-seq Sample Prep kit (IllumiNA RS-100-0801) according to the manufacturer??????_?????_?s protocol.

Limiting this progress are uncertainties about the complete structure mRNA transcripts, particularly with respect to alterNAtively spliced isoforms. Although second-generation RNA-seq provides a quantitative assay for transcriptioNAl and posttranscriptioNAl events, the accurate reconstruction of full-length mRNA isoforms is challenging with short-read technologies. By producing much longer reads, third generation sequencing offers to solve the assembly problem, but can suffer from lower read accuracy and throughput. Here, we combine these complementary technologies to define and quantify high-confidence transcript isoforms in maize. Six tissues (root, pollen, embryo, endosperm, immature ear, and immature tassel) of the B73 inbred line were used for mRNA sequencing with the IllumiNA Hiseq2000 PE101 platform to comprehensively quantitate gene/isoform expression. In parallel, intact cDNAs from the same samples were sequenced using the PacBio RS II platform. The latter used four size fractioNAted libraries (1-2kb, 2-3kb, 3kb-5kb, 5kb-10kb) to generate more than 2 million full length reads. PrelimiNAry findings suggest that mechanisms of alterNAtive splicing are differentially employed between different tissues. In addition, these data show promise to dramatically improve the status of maize genome annotation, with the detection of previously unidentified transcript isoforms, and uncovering previously unrecognized genes.

Six tissues (root, pollen, embryo, endosperm, immature ear, and immature tassel) of the B73 inbred line were used for mRNA sequencing with the IllumiNA Hiseq2000 PE101 platform to comprehensively quantitate gene/isoform expression. In parallel, intact cDNAs from the same samples were sequenced using the PacBio RS II platform. The latter used four size fractioNAted libraries (1-2kb, 2-3kb, 3kb-5kb, 5kb-10kb) to generate more than 2 million full length reads. PrelimiNAry findings suggest that mechanisms of alterNAtive splicing are differentially employed between different tissues. In addition, these data show promise to dramatically improve the status of maize genome annotation, with the detection of previously unidentified transcript isoforms, and uncovering previously unrecognized genes.

The latter used four size fractioNAted libraries (1-2kb, 2-3kb, 3kb-5kb, 5kb-10kb) to generate more than 2 million full length reads. PrelimiNAry findings suggest that mechanisms of alterNAtive splicing are differentially employed between different tissues. In addition, these data show promise to dramatically improve the status of maize genome annotation, with the detection of previously unidentified transcript isoforms, and uncovering previously unrecognized genes. This submission is data of IllumiNA Hiseq2000 PE101 reads."	NA	European Nucleotide Archive	NA

The genome-wide context-specific differential DNA methylation patterns and their influence on gene expression have rarely been investigated in crop species. Profiling of DNA methylation in five maize (Zea mays) inbred lines found that while DNA methylation levels for >99% of the aNAlyzed genomic regions are similar there are still 5,000 to 20,000 context-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between any two genotypes. The aNAlysis of identical-by-state genomic regions that have limited genetic variation provided evidence that DMRs can occur without local sequence variation but they are 50% less common than in regions with genetic variation. Characterization of the sequence-specificity of DMRs, location of DMRs relative to genes and transposons and patterns of DNA methylation in regions flanking DMRs reveals distinct subset of DMRs. RNAseq profiling of the same tissue revealed that only ~20% of genes with qualitative (on-off) differences in gene expression are associated with DMRs and there is little evidence for association of DMRs with genes that show quantitative differences in gene expression. We also identify a set of genes that may represent cryptic information that is silenced by DNA methylation in the reference B73 genome. Many of these genes exhibit NAtural variation in other genotypes suggesting the potential for selection to act upon existing epigenetic NAtural variation. This study provides insights into the origin and influences of DMRs in a crop species with a complex genome organization."	University of Minnesota	Springer Lab	NA

Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombiNAnt inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgeneratioNAl epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

We observed a gradual increase of paterNAl gene mRNAs in the 3- and 5-DAP kernels. In the 7-DAP endosperm, the majority of the tested genes reached a ratio of 2m:1p suggesting that paterNAl genes were nearly fully activated by 7 DAP.

The highest amount of paterNAlly expressed genes (PEGs) was found at 7 DAP mainly due to the significantly deviated parental allele expression ratio of these genes at this stage, while nearly 80% of the materNAlly expressed genes (MEGs) were specific to 10 DAP which were primarily attributed to the sharply increased expression levels compared to the other stages.

Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.  For ramosa mutant series, segregating families (1:1) of ra1-R, ra2-R, and ra3-fea1 mutant alleles, all introgressed at least 6 times into the B73 inbred background, were grown at CSHL Uplands Farm.  Field-grown plants were genotyped and collected 6-7 weeks after germiNAtion (V7-V8 stage).  First and second ear primordia were immediately hand-dissected, measured, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  For ra1, ra2 and ra3 mutants and wild-type controls, ears were pooled into two size classes: 1) 1mm class included a range of 0.7-1.5mm sized ears and nine ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates; 2) 2mm class included a range of 1.8-2.5mm sized ears and six ears were pooled for each of three biological replicates.  Wild-type samples were proportioNAl mixtures of heterozygote siblings segregating in ra1, ra2, and ra3 populations.  Variability factors (e.g. ear size within class, ear rank on the plant, and time of collection) were distributed evenly across pooled samples."	GEO	NA	NA

The maize leaf is an ideal system to study plant morphogenesis as it is subdivided into a proximal sheath and a distal blade, each with distinct developmental patterning. Specialised ligule and auricle structures form at the blade-sheath boundary. The auricles act as a hinge, allowing the leaf blade to project at an angle from the stem, while the ligule comprises an epidermally-derived fringe. Recessive liguleless1 mutants lack ligules and auricles, and have upright leaves. We utilized laser-microdissection RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed along discrete cell/tissue-specific domains along the proximal-distal axis of wild-type leaf primordia undergoing ligule initiation, and compared transcript accumulation in wild type and liguleless1 mutant leaf primordia. We identified transcripts that are specifically upregulated at the blade-sheath boundary. A surprising number of these ligule genes are also implicated to function during leaf initiation or lateral branching, and intersect multiple hormoNAl sigNAlling pathways. We propose that genetic modules utilised in leaf and/or branch initiation are redeployed to regulate ligule outgrowth from leaf primordia. Overall design: In this study, we aNAlysed the transcriptome associated with ligule formation using laser microdissection RNA-sequencing (LM-RNAseq). We quantified transcript accumulation in the PLB and adjacent pre-blade and pre-sheath regions of wild-type leaf primordia in order to identify candidate genes involved in proximal-distal patterning at the blade-sheath boundary. We also compared transcript accumulation in lg1-R mutants and wild-type siblings to identity genes acting downstream of LG1."	GEO	NA	NA

The endosperm of cereals is a main source of food, feed, and industrial raw materials worldwide. However, the gene regulatory networks that control endosperm cell differentiation remain largely unclear. As a first step toward characterizing these networks, we profiled the mRNAs in five major cell types of the differentiating endosperm and in the embryo and four materNAl compartments of the kernel. Comparisons of these mRNA populations revealed the diverged gene expression programs between filial and materNAl compartments, and an unexpected close correlation between embryo and the aleurone layer of endosperm. Gene co-expression network aNAlysis identified co-expression modules associated with single or multiple kernel compartments including modules for the endosperm cell types, some of which showed enrichment of previously identified temporally activated and/or imprinted genes. Detailed aNAlyses of a co-expression module highly correlated with the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) identified a regulatory module activated by MRP-1, a regulator of BETL differentiation and function. These results provide a high-resolution atlas of gene activity in the compartments of the maize kernel and help to uncover the regulatory modules associated with the differentiation of the major endosperm cell types. Overall design: RNAs from ten compartments of the maize kernel including the central starchy endosperm (CSE), conducting zone (CZ), aleurone (AL), basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), embryo-surrounding region (ESR), nucellus (NU), pericarp (PE), placenta-chalazal region (PC), the vascular region of the pedicel (PED), and the embryo (EMB) were isolated at 8 days after polliNAtion (DAP) using laser-capture microdissection and sequenced using an IllumiNA HiSeq 2000 platform."

In order to identify transcripts specifically induced in leaves infected by ???????-1,3-glucan-exposing strains, transcript patterns of leaves inoculated with GLS1 overexpressing PtrpC:GLS1 strains were compared with those of the WT. In PtrpC:GLS1-inoculated leaves, a total of 2179 genes were more than 2.5-fold increased, with many genes known as genes typically up-regulated in PAMP-triggered defense responses. These genes include genes encoding PR proteins enzymes involved in cell wall re-inforcemen, and terpene synthases possibly involved in phytoalexin synthesis. Furthermore, increased transcript abundance of genes encoding serine-threonine receptor-like kiNAses calmodulin, as well as zinc-finger and WRKY transcription factors have been identified. Other up-regulated genes encode proteins involved in protein degradation, i.e. proteases, ubiquitin ligases, as well as enzymes involved in synthesis of auxin or cytokinin phytohormones. In comparison, 2164 genes were more than 2.5-fold down-regulated in maize leaves infected by PtrpC:GLS1 strains, as compared to WT-infected leaves. Several of the encoded proteins are known susceptibility factors. Forty-six down-regulated genes code for proteins containing iron or manganese, or are involved in uptake of these ions, suggesting major re-arrangement of the redox-status in maize leaves after ???????-glucan perception.

We characterized developmental transitions by associating spatiotemporal expression profiles with morphological changes resulting from genetic perturbations that disrupt steps in a pathway controlling branching.  These are the RNA-seq datasets used in this study. Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.

We characterized developmental transitions by associating spatiotemporal expression profiles with morphological changes resulting from genetic perturbations that disrupt steps in a pathway controlling branching.  These are the RNA-seq datasets used in this study. Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Sections from ~30 sampled ears were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates to represent tip, mid, and base stages.  Tassels were hand-dissected, measured, separated by stage: 1-2mm (stg1), 3-4mm (stg2), and 5-7mm (stg3), and immediately frozen in liquid N.  For each stage, ~20-30 tassels were pooled for each of 2 biological replicates.

The maize leaf is an ideal system to study plant morphogenesis as it is subdivided into a proximal sheath and a distal blade, each with distinct developmental patterning. Specialised ligule and auricle structures form at the blade-sheath boundary. The auricles act as a hinge, allowing the leaf blade to project at an angle from the stem, while the ligule comprises an epidermally-derived fringe. Recessive liguleless1 mutants lack ligules and auricles, and have upright leaves. We utilized laser-microdissection RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed along discrete cell/tissue-specific domains along the proximal-distal axis of wild-type leaf primordia undergoing ligule initiation, and compared transcript accumulation in wild type and liguleless1 mutant leaf primordia. We identified transcripts that are specifically upregulated at the blade-sheath boundary. A surprising number of these ligule genes are also implicated to function during leaf initiation or lateral branching, and intersect multiple hormoNAl sigNAlling pathways. We propose that genetic modules utilised in leaf and/or branch initiation are redeployed to regulate ligule outgrowth from leaf primordia. Overall design: In this study, we aNAlysed the transcriptome associated with ligule formation using laser microdissection RNA-sequencing (LM-RNAseq). We quantified transcript accumulation in the PLB and adjacent pre-blade and pre-sheath regions of wild-type leaf primordia in order to identify candidate genes involved in proximal-distal patterning at the blade-sheath boundary. We also compared transcript accumulation in lg1-R mutants and wild-type siblings to identity genes acting downstream of LG1."	GEO	NA	NA

The inducer line in each pair has a haploid induction rate over 10%, while the non-inducer near-isogenic line in each pair has a haploid induction rate of less than 0.2% (wild-type levels). The trait is associated with the male gametophyte of maize (pollen), which is why pollen was sampled for this study.The haploid inducer and non-inducer line in each pair are compared to each other to identify differentially expressed genes that are associated with the haploid induction trait, in the context of a (mostly) fixed genetic background. Because the genetic backgrounds are not perfectly fixed (as they are near-isogenic), we expect that many of the DEGs found in a given comparison would reflect differences from other genetic differences between the parent lines, rather than specifically being due to the haploid inducer trait. Therefore wanted to include two different germplasm backgrounds and examine the overlap between them.Those two backgrounds are ??????_??????RWK??????_????? (in which there are RWK-HI (haploid inducer) and RWK-NIL (non-inducer) genotypes) and ??????_??????NP2222??????_????? (in which there are NP2222-HI (haploid inducer) and NP2222 (non-inducer) genotypes. By examining the DEG lists from both of these pairs of comparisons, and specifically looking at the overlap between them, one can more accurately derive a list of DEGs consistently associated with the haploid inducer trait in both of the genetic backgrounds."

NAtural sources of resistance from maize genotypes are used in conventioNAl breeding approaches, but the sigNAls and effectors involved in resistance in this important crop species are not well understood. Early transcriptioNAl changes associated with F. verticillioides infection were aNAlysed in resistant CO441 and susceptible CO354 maize genotypes using RNA-Sequencing technology. Transcript level were measured at 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi), reflecting the time point immediately preceding the onset of resistance in CO441, as determined by the absolute quantification of the fungal ???????-tubulin2 gene. More than 100 million sequence reads were generated for condition (inoculated/uninoculated). The sequence reads were aNAlyzed to measure gene expression levels and determine single nucleotide polymorphisms. We observed 2,551 transcripts with statistically significant differential expression before inoculation by comparing uninoculated control samples. Overall, a more induced expression of genes distributed in all functioNAl classes is found in the CO441 genotype, in particular a high percentage of differentially genes were more expressed only in the resistant genotype for the functioNAl class secondary metabolism. Furthermore, a total of 2,250 and 2,442 transcripts were differentially regulated after F. verticillioides inoculation in resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The genes in common were 1,028 genes and showed 5,342 SNPs variants, suggesting a certain variability in the defense responses of the two genotypes. Also at 72 hpi, secondary metabolism was the category where the most interesting differences between the two genotypes were observed to a greater extent. Pathways related to phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (e.g. anthranilate synthase, shikimate kiNAse), flavonoid biosynthesis (e.g. chalcone synthase) and lignin biosynthesis (e.g. cinNAmyl-alcohol dehydrogeNAse) appeared to be strongly influenced by infection in the CO441 genotype with up to 11-fold induction. Response to stress and resistance categories followed. In addition, transcriptioNAl modulation affected sigNAl transduction, including calcium sigNAling, ethylene sigNAling, MAP kiNAses, receptor-like kiNAses, and numerous transcription factors. Even though all these genes were well represented in both genotypes, it was observed that on the whole CO441 mounts a stronger gene induction, confirming its strengthening also in the specific response to inoculation.

NAtural sources of resistance from maize genotypes are used in conventioNAl breeding approaches, but the sigNAls and effectors involved in resistance in this important crop species are not well understood. Early transcriptioNAl changes associated with F. verticillioides infection were aNAlysed in resistant CO441 and susceptible CO354 maize genotypes using RNA-Sequencing technology. Transcript level were measured at 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi), reflecting the time point immediately preceding the onset of resistance in CO441, as determined by the absolute quantification of the fungal ???????-tubulin2 gene. More than 100 million sequence reads were generated for condition (inoculated/uninoculated). The sequence reads were aNAlyzed to measure gene expression levels and determine single nucleotide polymorphisms. We observed 2,551 transcripts with statistically significant differential expression before inoculation by comparing uninoculated control samples. Overall, a more induced expression of genes distributed in all functioNAl classes is found in the CO441 genotype, in particular a high percentage of differentially genes were more expressed only in the resistant genotype for the functioNAl class secondary metabolism. Furthermore, a total of 2,250 and 2,442 transcripts were differentially regulated after F. verticillioides inoculation in resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The genes in common were 1,028 genes and showed 5,342 SNPs variants, suggesting a certain variability in the defense responses of the two genotypes. Also at 72 hpi, secondary metabolism was the category where the most interesting differences between the two genotypes were observed to a greater extent. Pathways related to phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (e.g. anthranilate synthase, shikimate kiNAse), flavonoid biosynthesis (e.g. chalcone synthase) and lignin biosynthesis (e.g. cinNAmyl-alcohol dehydrogeNAse) appeared to be strongly influenced by infection in the CO441 genotype with up to 11-fold induction. Response to stress and resistance categories followed. In addition, transcriptioNAl modulation affected sigNAl transduction, including calcium sigNAling, ethylene sigNAling, MAP kiNAses, receptor-like kiNAses, and numerous transcription factors. Even though all these genes were well represented in both genotypes, it was observed that on the whole CO441 mounts a stronger gene induction, confirming its strengthening also in the specific response to inoculation. The identification of plant candidate resistance genes that interact with fungus could be exploited in future biotechnological approaches to increase disease resistance in susceptible maize genotypes."

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombiNAnt inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgeneratioNAl epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

As the first component of this phosphorelay cascade, mitogen-activated protein kiNAse kiNAse kiNAses (MAPKKKs) act as adaptors linking upstream sigNAling steps to the core MAPK cascade to promote the appropriate cellular responses; however, the functions of MAPKKKs in maize are unclear. Here, we identified 71 MAPKKK genes, of which 14 were novel, based on a computatioNAl aNAlysis of the maize (Zea mays L.) genome. Using an RNA-seq aNAlysis in the leaf, stem and root of maize under well-watered and drought-stress conditions, we identified 5,866 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 8 MAPKKK genes responsive to drought stress. Many of the DEGs were enriched in processes such as drought stress, abiotic stimulus, oxidation-reduction, and metabolic processes.  The other way round, DEGs involved in processes such as oxidation, photosynthesis, and starch, proline, ethylene, and salicylic acid metabolism were clearly co-expressed with the MAPKKK genes. Furthermore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) aNAlysis was performed to assess the relative expression levels of MAPKKKs. Correlation aNAlysis revealed that there was a significant correlation between expression levels of two MAPKKKs and relative biomass responsive to drought in 8 inbred lines.

Results: Using RNA-Seq technology with the Trinity assembled method, we generated a seedling plant transcriptome at a sequencing size of 51.78Gb of Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. from pooled RNA samples which included control (CK), cold (4?) and drought (PEG2000, 20%) stressed plant samples. A total of 414,232,462 high quality clean reads were used to conduct de novo assembly and annotation of genes without reference genome information. All of these reads were assembled into 251,145 transcripts (N50 = 1,269 bp) and 184,280 unigenes (N50 = 923 bp). A total of 3,504 up-regulated and 1,220 down-regulated genes were detected under cold stress and 532 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated genes were detected under drought stress. A Venn diagram indicated that 208 genes were affected by both cold and drought stresses. 3 cold stress pathways and 5 drought related pathways showed significant KEGG pathways. FunctioNAl enrichment aNAlyses identified many common or specific biological processes and gene sets in response to drought and cold stresses. The ABA dependent pathway, trehalose synthetic pathway and CBF6 gene of ICE1-CBF pathway may play important roles in the DEGs co-up-regulated by both stresses of Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. Conclusions: We aNAlyzed transcriptome data and gene expression profile information from seedlings of Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. under cold and drought stresses. Together these data provides the most comprehensive sequence study available for Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. and provides some important functioNAl genes and molecular mechanism information for improving the quality characteristic of maize in the future.

Many of the DEGs were enriched in processes such as drought stress, abiotic stimulus, oxidation-reduction, and metabolic processes.  The other way round, DEGs involved in processes such as oxidation, photosynthesis, and starch, proline, ethylene, and salicylic acid metabolism were clearly co-expressed with the MAPKKK genes. Furthermore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) aNAlysis was performed to assess the relative expression levels of MAPKKKs. Correlation aNAlysis revealed that there was a significant correlation between expression levels of two MAPKKKs and relative biomass responsive to drought in 8 inbred lines.

We employed the Smart Technology [38] of cDNA construction (Evrogen, Mint-Universal kit, Cat #: SK002; http://www.evrogen.com) to prepare cDNA of BETCs.  Basically, the experiment followed the directions shown in the kit manual. Briefly, the adapter pair CDS-1 (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC(T)30V N-3') (10 uM)  and PlugOligo-1 (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACGGGGGP-3') (15 uM) were used for synthesis of cDNA (protocol I , Section VI of the the kit manual). Reverse transcription was carried out on 1 ug total RNA of BETCs. 1 ug total RNA and 1 ul of each CDS-1 and PlugOligo-1 were mixed in 5 ul fiNAl volume adjusted by water.  The mix was incubated at 70 degrees C for 2 min and then 42 degrees C for 3 min.  First-strand cDNA synthesis was then initiated by the addition of RT Master Mix (First-Strand Buffer, DTT, dNTP, Mint reverse transcriptase) in a fiNAl volume of 10 ul.  The fiNAl concentration included: 1X First-Strand Buffer, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM of each dNTP.  The mixed solution was incubated at 42 degrees C for 30 min and again for 1.5 hr after addition of 5 ul IP-solution and then cooled on ice.  1 ul first-strand cDNA was taken to perform ds cDNA synthesis in a fiNAl volume of 50 ul, which contains 1X Encyclo PCR Buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 uM PCR Primer M1 (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3'), 1X Encyclo Polymerase Mix. We performed 21 cycles with the parameters 95 degrees C for 15 sec, 66 degrees C for 20 sec, and 72 degrees C for 3 min for ds cDNA synthesis by PCR amplification. Amplified cDNA PCR product was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, CA), and the fiNAl concentration is 55 ng/ul"	RANDOM	PAIRED - NOMINAL_SDEV: 44; NOMINAL_LENGTH: 145; 	"We sampled the first 0.5cm of the most basal part of leaf 4 3 days after appearance, always at the same time of the day to minimize diurNAl effects All traits were measured in a series of experiments in a single growth chamber.

Leaf material was collected at 77 days after planting, at which stage there were a large number of GLS disease necrotic lesions on lower leaves (8% surface area on average determined by digital image aNAlysis), but very few lesions and only at chlorotic stage on leaves above the ear (average of 0.2% lesion surface area). Method:To collect material that reflected a difference between C.zeiNA infected B73 leaves and control B73 leaf material, samples were collected from two lower GLS infected leaves (second and third leaf internode below ear) , and two upper leaves with minimal GLS symptoms (second and third internode above ear), respectively.  The two lower leaves from each plant were pooled prior to RNA extraction, and the two upper leaves from each plant were pooled prior to RNA extraction.  Upper and lower leaf samples from three maize B73 plants were subjected to RNA sequencing individually. The three maize plants were selected randomly as one plant per row from three rows of ten B73 plants each. Result: A systems genetics strategy revealed regions on the maize genome underlying co-expression of genes in susceptible and resistance responses, including a set of 100 genes common to the susceptible response of sub-tropical and temperate maize. Overall design: To collect material that reflected a difference between C.zeiNA infected B73 leaves and control B73 leaf material, samples were collected from two lower GLS infected leaves (second and third leaf internode below ear) , and two upper leaves with minimal GLS symptoms (second and third internode above ear), respectively.

In order to generate a global overview of Zea mexicaNA transcriptome data, 3 of complement DNA (cDNA) libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from root, stem, and leave mixed tissues of Zea MexicaNA from Control (24?), Cold (4?) and Drought (PEG2000, 20%) treatments and each teatment has two repetitions. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were merged and de novo to generate all transcripts set by Trinity with default parameter, which will be treated as reference genome. The number of paired-reads of each sample were mapped to reference genome by Bowtie software v1.1.1 and the number of mapped reads were calculated by RSEM. qRT-PCR validation was performed using BIO-RAD CFX96 sequence detection system and SYBR Green assays. Results: Using RNA-Seq technology with the Trinity assembled method, we generated a seedling plant transcriptome at a sequencing size of 51.78Gb of Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. from pooled RNA samples which included control (CK), cold (4?) and drought (PEG2000, 20%) stressed plant samples. A total of 414,232,462 high quality clean reads were used to conduct de novo assembly and annotation of genes without reference genome information. All of these reads were assembled into 251,145 transcripts (N50 = 1,269 bp) and 184,280 unigenes (N50 = 923 bp). A total of 3,504 up-regulated and 1,220 down-regulated genes were detected under cold stress and 532 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated genes were detected under drought stress. A Venn diagram indicated that 208 genes were affected by both cold and drought stresses. 3 cold stress pathways and 5 drought related pathways showed significant KEGG pathways. FunctioNAl enrichment aNAlyses identified many common or specific biological processes and gene sets in response to drought and cold stresses. The ABA dependent pathway, trehalose synthetic pathway and CBF6 gene of ICE1-CBF pathway may play important roles in the DEGs co-up-regulated by both stresses of Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. Conclusions: We aNAlyzed transcriptome data and gene expression profile information from seedlings of Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. under cold and drought stresses. Together these data provides the most comprehensive sequence study available for Zea mays ssp. mexicaNA L. and provides some important functioNAl genes and molecular mechanism information for improving the quality characteristic of maize in the future.

SRP021921	Zea mays Variation	Other	"Oligonucleotides comprising the top and bottom strands of each barcode adapter and a common adapter were diluted (separately) in TE (50 microM each) and annealed in a thermocycler (95C, 2 min; ramp down to 25C by 0.1C/s; 25C, 30 min; 4C hold). Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to iNActivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a fiNAl volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the IllumiNA sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a fiNAl Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the fiNAl elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combiNAtion, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome ANAlyzer II (IllumiNA, Inc.).

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombiNAnt inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgeneratioNAl epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines. Overall design: Genome-wide cytosine methylation map in 2 maize strains by bisulfite sequencing, and RNA and small RNA profiles in the same tissue using IllumiNA platform."	GEO	NA	NA
